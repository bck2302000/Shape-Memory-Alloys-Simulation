# Shape-Memory-Alloys-Simulation

This work aims to minimize the energy of the Shape Memory Alloy as well as to find
the optimal configuration by using different model approaches by taking into account the
computational time and accuracy.

This repository contains the code for brute force algorithm and the simulated annealing algorithm.
